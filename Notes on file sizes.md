1. If we convert/compress and get these results:
```typescript
Original file: 1MB
Converted WebP (blob method): 1.5MB
Converted WebP (dataURL method): 1.2MB
Compressed original format: 800KB
```
→ It will return the compressed original format (800KB) because it's the smallest

2. But if we get these results:
```typescript
Original file: 1MB
Converted WebP (blob method): 600KB
Converted WebP (dataURL method): 700KB
Compressed original format: 900KB
```
→ It will return the WebP blob version (600KB) because it achieved better compression

3. And if `allowLargerFiles` is false and we get:
```typescript
Original file: 1MB
Converted WebP (blob method): 1.2MB
Converted WebP (dataURL method): 1.3MB
Compressed original format: 1.1MB
```
→ It will return the original file (1MB) because no compression method produced a smaller file

The key benefits of this approach are:
- It's safer (never returns a larger file unless explicitly allowed)
- It's adaptive (uses whatever method works best for that specific image)
- It's more reliable across different platforms/browsers
- It still allows for compression when possible

This is especially useful because different image types compress differently:
- Some JPEGs might compress better as WebP
- Some PNGs might be already optimized and best left in original format
- Some images might compress better with the original format compression

The code automatically finds the best option for each case.
